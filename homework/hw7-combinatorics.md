HW 7: Combinatorics
========

Below are 5 problems to practice what you learned about combinatorics. Each question can be completed mathematically. Make sure to show your work and include any reasoning for how you calculated your answer. Please write your answers in a **.qmd** or **.rmd** file. Then knit the report to a **PDF document**, and upload it to the HW 7 **Gradescope** assignment page. 

You can review the notes and formulas from class on the [course website](https://tgstewart.cloud/compprob/) under "[7 Combinatorics](https://tgstewart.cloud/compprob/Combinatorics.html)." You will also find these same practice problems at the end of the notes on the course website.

### Practice Problems

1. Lottery Problem: A lottery requires players to choose 6 numbers from 1 to 49. What is the probability of winning the jackpot by matching all 6 numbers?

2. Committee Formation: A club has 12 members. How many ways can a committee of 4 members be formed?

3. Suppose you are building a machine learning model to predict customer churn. You have 10 features to choose from.
   1. If you want to experiment with models using all possible combinations of 3 features, how many models do you need to build?
   2. If computational constraints limit you to building models with at most 5 features, how many models can you build?

4.  In a dataset of 10,000 emails, 1000 are spam. You randomly select 100 emails. 
    1.  What is the probability that exactly 10 of the selected emails are spam?
    2.  What is the probability that at least one of the selected emails is spam?

5. [Analyzing Customer Reviews] A data science team is building a sentiment analysis model to classify customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. They have a dataset of 10,000 reviews, and they want to manually label a subset of 100 reviews for training the model. Due to time constraints, they decide to focus on labeling reviews that express strong sentiment (either highly positive or highly negative). They estimate that 20% of the reviews express strong positive sentiment, and 10% express strong negative sentiment.
   1. How many different ways are there to choose 100 reviews for manual labeling if they donâ€™t consider the sentiment of the reviews?
   2. How many ways are there to choose 50 strongly positive reviews and 50 strongly negative reviews for labeling?
